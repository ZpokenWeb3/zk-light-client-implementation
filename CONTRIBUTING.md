# Contribution Guidelines

Hello! Thank you for your interest in joining the mission to improve zero-knowledge protocols. 
We welcome contributions from anyone online.

Note, however, that all the contributions are subject to review, and not every contribution is guaranteed to be merged.
It is highly advised to reach out to developers (for example, by creating an issue) before preparing a significant
change in the codebase, and explicitly confirm that this contribution will be considered for merge. Otherwise, it is
possible to discover that a feature you have spent some time on does not align with the core team vision or capacity to
maintain a high quality of given submission long term.

## Ways to contribute

There are many ways to contribute to the Near ZK light client:

1. Open issues: if you find a bug, have something you believe needs to be fixed, or have an idea for a feature, please
   open an issue.
2. Add color to existing issues: provide screenshots, code snippets, and whatever you think would be helpful to resolve
   issues.
3. Resolve issues: either by showing an issue isn't a problem and the current state is ok as is or by fixing the problem
   and opening a PR.

## Fixing issues

To contribute code fixing issues, please fork the repo, fix an issue, commit, add documentation as per the PR template,
and the repo's maintainers will review the PR.
[here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
for guidance how to work with PRs created from a fork.

## Licenses

If you contribute to this project, your contributions will be made to the project under both Apache 2.0 and the MIT
license.


## Code of Conduct

Be polite and respectful.

## FAQ

**Q**: I have a small contribution that's not getting traction/being merged?

**A**: Due to capacity, contributions that are simple renames of variables or stylistic/minor text improvements, one-off
typo fix will not be merged. If you do find any typos or grammar errors, the preferred avenue is to improve the existing
spellchecker. Given you have no technical prowess to do so, please create an issue. Please note that issues will be
resolved on a best effort basis.
